# Anonymous-Feedback-System
 This is my first project called Anonymous Feedback System.
 It is a feedback portal which takes feedback about college infrastructure from students where student details are hidden. 
 I have used PHP (Backend language) ,HTML ,CSS (Frontend languages), MySQL database over Xampp software mostly.
 This project consists of three interfaces Admin interface, Student interface and Faculty Interface.
 Admin can add students and faculty to the feedback system and can view feedback given by the students where student details are anonymous. 
 Student can give feedback after logging into our feedback portal with username and password given by admin. Where as faculty can view their feedback given by students to them which is anonymous.
 Faculty is also given with username and password by the admin to login and to view their feedback.
